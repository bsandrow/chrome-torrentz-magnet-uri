==========================
chrome-torrentz-magnet-uri
==========================

Each torrent page on Torrentz.eu contains all of the information needed to
create a magnet URI, but they don't actually provide a magnet URI. This will
add a little icon in the location bar, which you can click on to open the
magnet URI for that Torrentz torrent page.

Notes
-----

1. Currently this only extracts the info hash and the name of the torrent.
It's possible to add trackers into the magnet URI, but that's a future feature.

2. jquery.min.js is at version 1.8.3 (for quick reference).

3. images/icon-128.png came from a site that said it was free for commercial use.

4. images/icon-14.gif was sourced from thepiratebay.se.

5. images/icon-12.gif was sourced from magnet-uri.sf.net.
